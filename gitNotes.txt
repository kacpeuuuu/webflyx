Files have states in Git
    untracked: Not being tracked by Git
    staged: Marked for inclusion in the next commit
    committed: Saved to the repository's history

git status - checks the status of the files in a directory


git config --add --local <section.key> "name the value of the key" 
git config --add --global <section.key> "name the value of the key" 

git config --get <section.key>
git config --unset <section.key>
git config --unset-all <section.key>            if a key has multiple instances use this if all values are to be deleted
                                                --unset flag only works with a single instance of a key.


git config --remove-section <section>


There are several locations where Git can be configured. From more general to more specific, they are:

    system: /etc/gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all users on the system
    global: ~/.gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all projects of a user
    local: .git/config, a file that configures Git for a specific project
    worktree: .git/config.worktree, a file that configures Git for part of a project

checking existing branches
    git branch
    
creating a branch
    git branch my_new_branch
switching to use the brand new branch
    git switch my_new_branch

doing it in one go
    git switch -c my_new_branch // creates and switches to the new branch if does not exist creates it
